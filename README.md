# Minesweeper game
An advanced version of the original Minesweeper game. The game supports all basic Minesweeper concepts including hidden mines, flagging, a timer, and a field of tiles with the possibility of playing the game at different difficulties. The game also supports additional concepts such as scoreboards for each difficulty, which are stored externally in files in order for them to stay consistent even after restarting the game. In order to prevent cheating by editing the scoreboard, a simple encryption mechanism was implemented using ciphers.
